# SBB Ticket Audit API
This Projects provides all Backend functionality for the SBB Ticket Audit App. The App allows you to summerize your spendings on online SBB purchasing. 

## What it does
You receive a confirmation E-Mail for every bought online SBB Ticket. This App gathers all the Data together and provides a readable summary of all your purchases. Therefore, the App needs to have access on your Mail Accout (by now, only Google Mail Accounts are considered). At the end of the day, the App should answer the question if you should buy a Generalabonnement or not.
